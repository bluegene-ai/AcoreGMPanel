# Acore GM Panel

A web game management toolkit for AzerothCore realms. Acore GM Panel is a modern MVC control panel for [AzerothCore](https://www.azerothcore.org/) realms. It streamlines daily server operations with a consistent UI, unified tooling, and multi-realm aware services that cover the most common GM and administrator workflows.

## Highlights

- **Modular architecture** – Each feature lives in an isolated domain (Account, Item, Creature, Quest, Mail, Mass Mail, Bag Query, Item Ownership, SmartAI, SOAP). Modules share common helpers, middleware, and UI components.
- **Multi-realm support** – Dynamic realm switching with per-realm database and SOAP credentials, plus inheritance rules for shared authentication.
- **Secure by default** – CSRF protection, authentication middleware, audit logging, and configurable SOAP whitelisting.
- **Consistent UX** – Shared layout, design tokens, reusable components, and a front-end helper (`panel.js`) that abstracts base-path aware API calls.
- **Setup wizard** – Five step installer that validates environment, collects credentials, creates generated config, and locks the installation.

## System Requirements

| Component | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| PHP       | 8.1 or later (tested with 8.1/8.2) |
| Extensions| `pdo_mysql`, `mbstring`, `soap`, `intl` (recommended), `json`, `openssl` |
| Database  | MySQL / MariaDB compatible with AzerothCore schemas |
| Web server| Apache / Nginx (rewrite capable) |
| Composer  | 2.x (optional but recommended for autoload refresh) |

> The setup wizard performs runtime checks for PHP version and mandatory extensions. Ensure CLI and web SAPIs share the same PHP build.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/bluegene-ai/AcoreGMPanel.git
  cd AcoreGMPanel
  ```
2. **Install PHP dependencies (optional)** – Composer is only required when you change namespaces.
  ```bash
  composer install
  ```
3. **Prepare writable directories**
  - `storage/`
  - `storage/logs/`
  - `storage/cache/`
  - `config/generated/`

4. **Configure web server**
  - Point the document root to `public/`.
  - Ensure URL rewriting routes all requests to `public/index.php`.
  - Set proper permissions for the PHP user on the writable directories above.

5. **Run the setup wizard**
  - Access the site in a browser. If `install.lock` is missing you will be redirected to `/setup`.
  - Complete the five steps: environment check → connection details → connectivity tests → administrator account → generated config.
  - After success the wizard creates files under `config/generated/` and writes `config/generated/install.lock`.

6. **Login and explore modules**
  - Use the administrator credentials you defined in the wizard.
  - Switch realms from the top navigation to verify multi-realm configuration.

### Manual configuration (optional)

If you prefer to bypass the wizard, copy defaults from `config/*.php` into `config/generated/` and adjust values manually:

- `config/generated/app.php`
- `config/generated/database.php`
- `config/generated/servers.php`
- `config/generated/soap.php`
- `config/generated/auth.php`

When deploying under a sub-path (e.g. `/panel`), set `'base_path' => '/panel'` in `config/generated/app.php`. All helper functions (`url()`, `asset()`, `Panel.api`) automatically respect this prefix.

## Further Reading

Additional focused guides live in the `docs/` directory and project root:



## Contributing

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Keep modules isolated—add new services under `app/Domain/<Module>` and controllers under `app/Http/Controllers/<Module>`.
3. Run PHP linting (`php -l`) and, if applicable, unit tests before submitting a PR.
4. Translate UI strings by updating both `resources/lang/en` and `resources/lang/zh_CN`.
